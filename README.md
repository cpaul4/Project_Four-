Project_Four-
=============
This is a C++ program that I created in Intermediate Programming. It has a design document that should explain what it does.
This program is supposed to be a virtual deli, where up to 10 customers can be served. The customers can pick out products and put them in their carts, and the Scale, Product and Cart classes exist to let them do this. The customers can be checked out, which means that an invoice of everything in their cart and its price is printed out.
